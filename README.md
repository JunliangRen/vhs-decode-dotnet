<!-- README_SYNC: 2026-08-12.03 -->

A .NET 11 rewrite of the decode-facing parts of
[`oyvindln/vhs-decode`](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode), targeting
upstream release `v0.4.0` at commit
`43155200da87c0d49eb37d8ec09b1372075ee8e4`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This remains a compatibility work in progress. The top-level decode paths are
> implemented and heavily tested, but every real capture and rare option
> combination has not yet been certified byte-for-byte.

**[Read the detailed English reference](docs/README.detailed.md)** for the full
compatibility matrix, implementation notes, historical benchmarks, validation
evidence, and remaining gaps.

## Overview

- Decode-only scope: VHS, CVBS, LaserDisc, and HiFi.
- Release 4.0 command names, options, aliases, defaults, diagnostics, and output
  lifecycle are the compatibility target.
- VHS-family routing includes VHS/S-VHS, Betamax, Video8/Hi8, U-matic, Type C,
  EIAJ, and supported PAL/NTSC variants.
- TBC utility tools, the double-click GUI, and developer plotting windows are
  intentionally out of scope.
- The Visual Studio 2026 `.slnx` solution has **1,431** standard xUnit v3 tests
  that are visible in Test Explorer and runnable with `dotnet test`.

<!-- SECTION: start -->

## Get started

Download the current binary-only Windows x64 package from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JunliangRen/vhs-decode-dotnet/releases).
The package is built as a single-file `decode.exe`.

```powershell
decode.exe vhs [upstream options] input.lds output
decode.exe cvbs [upstream options] input.lds output
decode.exe ld [upstream options] input.lds output
decode.exe hifi [upstream options] input.lds output.wav
```

Standalone command aliases such as `vhs-decode.exe` and `ld-decode.exe` are
also supported. Use `decode.exe <command> --help` for the complete compatible
option set.

<!-- SECTION: profiles -->

## Profiles and backends

`--compat-version` selects upstream behavior:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `v0.4.0` | Default. Targets the pinned Python release behavior. |
| `current` | Opt-in staged behavior from upstream PR 341, including newer VHS sync and color-under processing. |

The strict compatibility oracle is Python v0.4.0 commit `g4315520` with
`--threads 0`. Python output hashes are not stable across its worker counts, so
multithreaded Python runs are used for speed measurements only.

`--dsp-backend` selects the DSP implementation:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `exact` | Default managed path for compatibility-sensitive decoding. |
| `ipp-fast` | Experimental Windows x64 VHS and LaserDisc real-RF paths using Intel IPP. It can change floating-point bits and never silently falls back to `exact`. |

```powershell
decode.exe vhs --compat-version current --dsp-backend ipp-fast `
  --threads 20 input.lds output
```

LaserDisc now routes its video, EFM, and analog-audio full-complex FFT stages
through IPP. CVBS and HiFi still reject `ipp-fast`; use `exact` whenever
release-compatible behavior is required. See the
[detailed backend notes](docs/README.detailed.md#performance) before using IPP
for compatibility-sensitive work.

<!-- SECTION: performance -->

## Latest performance

This startup-inclusive `--start 100 --length 160` snapshot uses one fixed private
local 40 MHz PAL VHS `.ldf` fixture; its filename is intentionally not published.
All 90 Python and .NET Release measurements were completed in the same
2026-08-12 batch with the candidate based on main `ea1bb8e`, using forward,
reverse, and mixed passes. This replaces the prior mixed-batch snapshot.
Compatibility is evaluated separately from speed.

Each .NET cell shows median wall time and speedup versus its profile-matched
Python column. The default is **5 workers**; three-run ranges are in the
[detailed performance notes](docs/README.detailed.md#performance). A ratio moves
when either the .NET time or its Python denominator moves, and historical tables
using another fixture or window are not directly comparable. Same-moment .NET
revision A/B runs, rather than old ratio cells, determine causal regressions.

The latest isolated change uses managed AVX for double-complex inverse FFT
normalization while preserving the scalar multiply order and avoiding FMA or
reassociation. Eight opposite-order kernel pairs reduced median wall time by
26.2% and CPU time by 25.0%, with identical hashes and allocations. Across
three opposite-order 1,000-frame Exact `current --threads 20` pairs, mean wall
time moved from 39.867 to 39.515 seconds (0.88% lower) and CPU time from 315.260
to 305.969 seconds (2.95% lower). All nine compatibility surfaces matched in
every pair, and memory remained bounded.

Every .NET profile/thread cell was deterministic across its three refreshed
runs. Merged Python PR341 was deterministic in its pinned reference set; Python
v0.4.0 produced 15 distinct luma, chroma, JSON, and normalized-log hashes in 15
runs, so the strict oracle remains Python v0.4.0 `g4315520 --threads 0`.
Commands, ranges, binary hashes, memory bounds, and historical measurements are in the
[detailed performance reference](docs/README.detailed.md#performance).

<!-- SECTION: compatibility -->

## Compatibility status

The main decode pipelines, streaming outputs, recovery behavior, and CLI
surface are implemented. Focused tests and real-RF gates cover luma, chroma,
JSON, ordered `fileLoc`, stdout, normalized stderr/logs, determinism, and
bounded memory. Rare captures and uncommon option interactions remain ongoing
work, so a successful build or equal file size alone is not treated as proof
of compatibility.

TBC, chroma, JSON, and log files are opened for concurrent reading while a
decode is running, allowing compatible preview tools to inspect partial output
without blocking the writer.

On native-input routes, direct raw `fLaC` `.ldf`/`.flac` inputs that are 40 kHz
mono PCM16 and contain at most `Int32.MaxValue` samples use the bundled
libsndfile reader. Ordinary parallel VHS decode can also use libsndfile for a
narrowly gated oversized fixed-block raw FLAC without a seek table; integer
mapping reproduces the pinned FFmpeg/PyAV frame starts and rewind/restart
boundaries, with one-way fallback at the same logical sample on any failure.
`--threads 0/1`, debug-plot and GNU Radio AFE modes, nonzero `--sharpness`,
other command families, default VHS `.flac`, CVBS, Ogg/FLAC, stereo, PCM24,
other sample rates, and unfinished or ineligible headers retain FFmpeg.
