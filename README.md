<!-- README_SYNC: 2026-07-18.2 -->

.NET 10 rewrite of the decode-facing parts of
[`oyvindln/vhs-decode`](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode), focused on
release `v0.4.0` at commit
`43155200da87c0d49eb37d8ec09b1372075ee8e4`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a work-in-progress compatibility port. The top-level decode paths are
> implemented and heavily tested, but the project does not yet claim
> byte-for-byte parity for every real capture and rare option interaction.

<!-- SECTION: scope -->

## Scope

This port implements only the decode applications:

- `decode.py vhs`
- `decode.py cvbs`
- `decode.py ld`
- `decode.py hifi`
- standalone aliases equivalent to `vhs-decode`, `cvbs-decode`,
  `ld-decode`, and `hifi-decode`

The following are intentionally out of scope:

- TBC utility tools and unrelated helper applications
- the double-click user-operation GUI
- Matplotlib `--debug_plot` windows and line-profiler UI/report rendering
- filter-tuning UI that is not required by the decode pipeline

Decode-side options that reference those tools are still parsed where upstream
CLI compatibility requires it.

<!-- SECTION: status -->

## Status

| Area | Status | Current boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Solution and tests | Implemented | .NET 10 `.slnx`; standard xUnit v3 tests work in Visual Studio Test Explorer and with `dotnet test`. |
| CLI and arguments | Implemented and snapshot-tested | Facade and standalone help, aliases, defaults, validation, diagnostics, and exit behavior target v0.4.0. |
| VHS and tape families | Implemented; rare capture gaps remain | VHS, S-VHS, Betamax, Video8/Hi8, U-matic, Type C, EIAJ, and supported PAL/NTSC variants share the release-compatible decode path. |
| CVBS | Implemented for release-supported systems | PAL and NTSC paths run; uncommon vblank and cross-option cases need more real-capture fixtures. |
| LaserDisc | Implemented; rare capture gaps remain | Video, VBI, EFM, analog audio, AC3, RF-TBC, metadata, recovery, and PAL/NTSC paths are connected. |
| HiFi | Implemented; real-capture verification remains | Typed v0.4.0 CLI, bounded parallel decode, post-processing, WAV/FLAC output, preview, and GNU Radio mode are connected. |
| Inputs | Broadly implemented | Raw input plus common FFmpeg/PyAV-equivalent container paths are covered; rare codec and timestamp cases remain. |
| Outputs and recovery | Implemented; edge cases remain | Streaming TBC/audio output, JSON snapshots, SQLite, logs, disk-space handling, and recovery ordering are covered. |
| Interactive UI | Out of scope | Decode user UI and developer plotting/report windows are intentionally not implemented. |

“Implemented” means the runtime path exists and has focused compatibility tests.
It does not mean that every possible capture has already been proven identical.

<!-- SECTION: coverage -->

## Compatibility coverage

### Commands and parameters

- Traditional `Program.Main` entry point and `decode.py`-style dispatch.
- `decode.exe`, `vhs-decode.exe`, `cvbs-decode.exe`, `ld-decode.exe`,
  and `hifi-decode.exe` apphosts.
- Release 4.0 option names, aliases, defaults, positional arguments, help text,
  validation ordering, Python-style numeric behavior, and error formatting.
- VHS format catalogs and parameter files for the supported tape families and
  color systems.
- Standard stdin/stdout behavior and upstream-compatible file validation.

### Decode pipeline

- RF filtering, FM demodulation, sync and level detection, line-zero recovery,
  field parity, HSync refinement, TBC resampling, dropout detection, chroma,
  wow correction, AGC, and metadata generation.
- `--use_saved_levels` reuses prior sync levels, retries failed saved levels,
  and forces full detection on the next VHS field after at least 30
  line-location errors, matching v0.4.0 state behavior.
- VHS/S-VHS/Betamax/Video8/Hi8/U-matic/Type C/EIAJ routing and PAL, NTSC,
  PAL-M, PAL-N, MESECAM, NTSC-J, 405-line, and 819-line compatibility paths
  where supported by upstream release 4.0.
- LaserDisc VBI, CAV/CLV interpretation, analog audio, EFM/pre-EFM, AC3,
  automatic MTF, AGC, VITS, player-skip detection, and recovery state.
- HiFi carrier decode, dropout compensation, head-switch interpolation,
  normalization, preview, GNU Radio transport, and ordered output.

### Runtime and output behavior

- Exact or normalized upstream diagnostics for covered branches, including
  recovery offsets, field-order actions, parameter-file logging, and partial
  output finalization.
- Streaming `.tbc`, `_chroma.tbc`, JSON, SQLite, PCM, EFM, pre-EFM, RF-TBC,
  AC3, WAV, and FLAC paths where applicable.
- Periodic recovery JSON snapshots and upstream-style partial-file lifecycle.
- Active TBC, chroma, JSON, and raw audio sidecars remain concurrently readable
  while decode continues, so preview tools do not need to wait for completion.

<!-- SECTION: performance -->

## Performance

Performance work is part of the implementation, while deterministic output and
release compatibility remain the first constraint.

- `-t` / `--threads` drives bounded parallel RF demodulation and filtering;
  stream, FFmpeg, and GNU Radio reads stay ordered.
- A stream-scoped decoded RF cache avoids duplicate FFT work across overlapping
  field reads while keeping memory bounded.
- VHS sessions retain at most 20 compute-only lookahead RF blocks and decode at
  most eight of them concurrently. This overlaps the next field with current
  TBC work without allowing FFT allocation bursts to grow with `--threads`.
  Input reads remain ordered, and pending work is cancelled on seek or disposal.
- Long TBC sinc-resampling jobs share the worker budget and preserve output
  order; `--threads 0` and `--threads 1` retain deterministic serial paths.
- HiFi uses bounded parallel block decoding followed by ordered
  post-processing and writing.
- Managed FFT workers reuse scratch buffers and immutable root tables, use
  in-place transforms where safe, and avoid full-field clones on aligned paths.
- RF span assembly writes directly into the requested output window instead of
  allocating whole-block field arrays and slicing a second copy.
- AVX/FMA kernels accelerate LD float32 quantization, VHS chroma rotation, and
  complex frequency filtering while preserving verified NumPy rounding and
  scalar fallbacks.
- Recovery metadata is disk-streamed; its snapshot queue has capacity one, and
  field-order history and RF caches have hard limits. Long decodes therefore do
  not retain every decoded field or enqueue an unbounded amount of future work.

On one Windows fixture machine, one-frame Release measurements were:

| Decode | This port | Python v0.4.0 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| NTSC VHS | 2.346 s | 7.193 s |
| NTSC LaserDisc | 1.651 s | 5.865 s |

These numbers are fixture-specific, not universal benchmarks. A PAL LD
four-field Core probe reduced managed allocation from 5.12 GiB to 1.96 GiB
while preserving verified output. On a reproducible 40-frame PAL VHS probe,
the current bounded pipeline changed `--threads 1/5/20` from
16.48/9.06/8.07 s to 15.83/8.81/7.48 s. TBC and JSON hashes remained identical;
the 20-thread peak was about 1.08 GiB, a fixed performance budget.

A separate 1.31 GB, 68-second sustained probe produced 8.94, 9.11, 8.96,
9.11, 8.98, and 9.08 MiB/s in consecutive post-warmup ten-second windows.
Later windows did not slow down, and their average working set stayed around
0.90-0.92 GiB instead of growing with decoded duration.

<!-- SECTION: build -->

## Build and test

Requirements:

- .NET 10 SDK
- Visual Studio 2026 for IDE use
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on `PATH` for FFmpeg-backed container inputs
- `ffmpeg` for default HiFi FLAC output

```powershell
dotnet restore VHSDecodeDotNet.slnx
dotnet build VHSDecodeDotNet.slnx -c Release --no-restore
dotnet test VHSDecodeDotNet.slnx -c Release --no-build --no-restore
```

The current formal Release build has zero warnings and errors. The xUnit v3
project exposes **742** independently discoverable tests to both
`dotnet test` and Visual Studio Test Explorer.

<!-- SECTION: usage -->

## Usage

Show facade or standalone help:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/VHSDecode.Cli -- vhs --help
dotnet run --project src/VHSDecode.Cli -- cvbs --help
dotnet run --project src/VHSDecode.Cli -- ld --help
dotnet run --project src/VHSDecode.Cli -- hifi --help
```

After a Release build, use either facade dispatch or an apphost alias:

```powershell
src\VHSDecode.Cli\bin\Release\net10.0\decode.exe vhs [upstream options] input output
src\VHSDecode.Cli\bin\Release\net10.0\vhs-decode.exe [upstream options] input output
```

Use the matching `cvbs`, `ld`, or `hifi` command and its upstream v0.4.0
arguments. Run `--help` for the exact accepted surface.

<!-- SECTION: preview -->

## Outputs and live preview

Video decode output files are opened with read/write sharing compatible with
upstream Python behavior. While a decode is active:

- `.tbc` and `_chroma.tbc` can be opened and read as they grow.
- published `.tbc.json` recovery snapshots can be parsed by another process.
- LD `.pcm`, `.efm`, and `.prefm` sidecars can be read concurrently.
- allowing readers does not add a copy or lock on the write hot path; practical
  performance depends mainly on competing storage I/O from the preview tool.

The writer remains the authority for file length and snapshot publication.
Readers must tolerate a growing TBC file and replace/reopen JSON snapshots.

<!-- SECTION: verification -->

## Verification

The test suite is standard xUnit v3, not a custom test executable. Coverage
includes:

- CLI/help/error snapshots and format/parameter matrices
- deterministic DSP and floating-point compatibility fixtures
- serial/worker output and state-transition comparisons
- TBC, chroma, JSON, SQLite, audio, and sidecar lifecycle tests
- recovery, seek, parity, field-order, and diagnostic ordering
- active-output sharing and partial-file readability
- differential fixtures generated against upstream release 4.0

Verified fixtures include byte-exact outputs and stable SHA-256 baselines.
The full per-algorithm inventory and hashes are kept in the shared evidence
document linked below.

<!-- SECTION: remaining -->

## Remaining work

These are bounded parity and verification gaps, not missing top-level commands:

- rare container codec and timestamp behavior outside current fixtures
- additional HiFi real-capture end-to-end baselines
- PAL LaserDisc, AC3, and verbose VITS real-capture edge cases
- uncommon VHS/CVBS vblank, chroma track-phase, and cross-option interactions
- rare first-HSync/vblank recovery and complete JSON/SQLite field metadata
- remaining TBC writer bit-compatibility edges and output parity across every
  format, option combination, and real capture
- continued CPU utilization, allocation, SIMD, and worker-scheduling profiling
  after compatibility is protected by fixtures

Interactive decode UI and TBC utility tools are outside this goal and are not
tracked as remaining decode compatibility work.

## Detailed evidence

The previous long-form implementation and differential verification inventory
is preserved in
[`docs/COMPATIBILITY_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY_EVIDENCE.md). It contains
the detailed algorithm notes, numerical boundaries, output hashes, and fixture
results shared by all language versions of this README.
